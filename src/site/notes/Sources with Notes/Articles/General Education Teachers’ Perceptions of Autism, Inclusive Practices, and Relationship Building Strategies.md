# Notes about the article

This article describes ways that general education teachers think of the students
they have that have Autism. The authors also compile that information and go into detail
ok how some teachers create inclusive classrooms. The article will be used to help find
the best ways to incorporate neurodiverse ways of inclusion into the curriculum I plan to
make.
