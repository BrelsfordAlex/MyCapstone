# Notes about the article

The article goes into depth on how autistic young adults feel towards the
mainstream supports that they are offered at schools, things like peer support, longer test
times, and even some designs for better support. This will be useful because the practical
implications and the suggested peer support designs can help me develop the space
needed to eventually carry out the curriculum.
