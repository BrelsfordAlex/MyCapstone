# An examination of teacher attitudes towards children with autismjrs3_1181 70..78

*Meungguk Park and Morgan Chitiyo Southern Illinois University Carbondale, USA*

*Key words*: Autism, attitude, school teachers, developmental disorder, beliefs.

**Since Leo Kanner first described it in 1943, autism has attracted a flurry of research. That research has transformed an esoteric condition into a better understood disorder. In addition to shifting conceptualisations, the new research seems to have influenced people's attitude towards the disorder. However, few studies have examined people's attitudes towards the disorder within the context of this robust research. This current study was designed to examine teachers' attitudes towards children with autism and to find out if teachers' attitudes have changed amidst this research. Results demonstrated that most of the teachers had positive attitude towards children with autism.**

# **Introduction**

Autism is a developmental disorder affecting a growing number of children. According to current estimates, 1 in every 150 children has autism (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007). Since Leo Kanner first described it in 1943, the disorder has stirred a lot of interest in the research community. As a result, different conceptualisations have emerged over the years. Early psychogenic theories that viewed autism as an emotional disorder have given way to more recent conceptualisations of autism as a developmental disability (Helps, Newsom-Davies and Callias, 1999; Stone and Rosenbaum, 1988). This shift in conceptualisation has been largely because of advances in research. Although there are still many questions to be answered about autism, a lot of progress has been achieved, resulting in us getting closer to understanding of the disorder (Helps et al., 1999).

Apart from shifting conceptualisations, the increased knowledge about autism has also affected professionals' beliefs, perceptions and attitudes about the disorder (Prelock, 2006). Boone and Kurtz (2002) defined attitude as 'a person's enduring favorable or unfavorable cognitive evaluations, emotional feelings, and action tendencies toward some object or data' (pp. 281–2). Professionals' attitudes are important because they determine the types of interventions that they will choose for the children and how successful those interventions will be (McGregor and Campbell, 2001).

In particular, teachers' attitudes towards children with autism are important for several reasons. First, teachers' attitudes can play a critical role in influencing the inclusion of children with autism into the mainstream of regular education settings. Second, teacher's attitude can influence their expectations for their students that will affect the students' self-image and academic performance (Alexander and Strain, 1978). As Hannah and Pliner (1983) noted, teachers who have unfavourable attitudes towards children with autism may have detrimental impacts on those children.

Despite the importance of teachers' attitudes towards children with special needs, there has been a lack of empirical research on teachers' attitudes towards autism. Few studies have been published on this subject. McGregor and Campbell (2001), for example, examined teachers' attitudes towards integration of children with autism in mainstream schools. Other studies have focused on attitudes of nonprofessionals including children (Reiter and Vitani, 2007; Swaim and Morgan, 2001) and adults (Chambres, Auxiette and Vansingle et al., 2008) towards children with autism. Olley, DeVellis and DeVellis et al. (1981) examined the attitude of regular education teachers towards children with autism. Olley and colleagues developed the Autism Attitude Scale for Teachers (AAST) and administered it to a sample of 95 regular education teachers. Results indicated that the regular education teachers' attitudes were moderately positive.

Apart from Olley et al.'s (1981) study, none of the above studies focused on teacher attitudes towards children with autism *per se*. Also, it is not known whether there is a difference in attitude towards children with autism between special education and regular education teachers. Given that special education teachers are likely to have more knowledge about autism compared with general education teachers, it would be interesting to see if that translates into more positive attitudes. In addition, demographic variables (e.g., age and gender) and types of exposure to children with disabilities (e.g., teaching experience or volunteer work experience with children with special needs) have been found to affect individuals' attitudes towards children with autism (Chambres et al., 2008; Rosenbaum, Armstrong and King, 1988; Royal and Roberts, 1987). Given this background, the purpose of this study was threefold: (1) to examine current teachers' attitudes towards children with autism; (2) to compare regular and special education teachers' attitudes; and (3) to assess the variables that affect teachers' attitudes such as demographic differences and the types of exposure that teachers had to children with disabilities.

This investigation is important because educational professionals' attitudes may affect educational practice and outcomes (McGregor and Campbell, 2001; Powell and Jordan, 1992). Teachers in particular 'convey messages of acceptance or disapproval through their own actions or symbolic gestures which represent a powerful influence on schoolwide acceptance of differences' (Horrocks, White and Roberts, 2008, p. 1464). Also, focusing on the attitudes of teachers towards children with autism is important because it may provide an invaluable source of data used in the development of teacher training and professional development programmes.

#### **Method**

#### *Participants*

The sample for the survey comprised of 40% (n = 127) of teachers from a small town in the Midwest. Of these, 115 were female and 12 were male. The town has five elementary schools, one middle school and one high school, and

**Table 1: Demographic characteristics of participants**

the total number of teachers in those schools is 320. The demographics of the 127 teachers who participated in this study are presented in Table 1. The sample consisted of mainly females (88%) and general education teachers (83%).

#### *Instrument*

The AAST developed by Olley et al. (1981) to measure the attitude of schoolteachers towards children with autism was used in this study (see Appendix for the instrument). The AAST is a Likert-type scale with the following five options: strongly disagree, disagree, uncertain, agree and strongly agree. The AAST is made up of two seven-item alternate forms. The alternate forms have a 0.84 correlation with one another. The two forms, A and B, have alpha reliability coefficients of 0.85 and 0.78, respectively. The alpha reliability for the 14-item combined form is 0.91. According to Olley and colleagues, the participants' attitudes are determined by summing the scores on the individual items. Because the instrument has both positively and negatively worded items, the negative items must first be converted to positive scores using a reverse-scoring formula (see Olley et al., 1981). Once the negatively worded items are reversescored, a total score can be computed by summing the individual item scores. The higher the scores, the more positive the participants' attitude and vice versa. These

authors changed the wording in some of the items to reflect 'person first language' (e.g., 'autistic children' was changed to 'children with autism').

*Internal consistency.* Internal consistency estimates (Cronbach's alpha) for the AAST were computed to confirm the reliability of the scale used in this study. The scale consists of two seven-item alternate forms. The reliability coefficients for form A, form B and the 14 items combined into a single form were 0.73, 0.84 and 0.87. Thus, the scale demonstrated good reliability and corroborated the findings of Olley et al. (1981).

#### *Procedure*

The AAST was distributed to all teachers (N = 320) in a small town in the Midwest. All surveys, which were completed anonymously, were obtained either via direct mail or distribution at meetings. The overall return rate was 40%.

#### **Results**

#### *Correlations among the variables of the study*

Attitude was significantly negatively correlated with age (*r* = -0.203, *P* = 0.022), implying that the younger the participants, the more positive their attitudes tended to be. Attitude was also negatively correlated with school level (*r* = -0.224, *P* = 0.011). In other words, elementary school teachers had the most positive attitudes than middle and high school teachers, whereas high school teachers had the least positive attitude. There was no significant relationship between years of teaching experience and attitude (*r* = -0.096,

#### *P* = 0.282).

#### *Descriptive statistics*

The participants' attitudes towards children with autism are presented in Table 2. The results indicated that the participants had positive attitudes towards children with autism [M = 4.06, standard deviation (SD) = 0.81]. The highest scores were obtained for those items that related to the inclusion of children with autism in public school programmes.

#### *Demographic differences in teacher attitude towards autism*

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated gender differences in teachers' attitudes [*F*(1, 125) = 10.104, *P* = 0.002]. Female teachers (M = 4.14, SD = 0.45) had more favourable attitudes towards children with autism than their male counterparts (M = 3.71, SD = 0.69). ANOVA indicated that teachers' attitudes differed significantly across the four age groups [*F*(3, 123) = 3.28, *P* = 0.023]. Tukey *post hoc* comparisons of the four groups indicated that teachers of age above 56 had significantly lower attitude score (M = 3.79, SD = 0.58) than the 20–35 years age group (M = 4.18, SD = 0.48) and the 46–55 years age group (M = 4.14, SD = 0.43). There was significant difference among the groups. These results are presented in Table 3.

*Note*: Items 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 14 were reverse-scored, as suggested by Olley et al. (1981), who developed the Autism Attitude Scale for Teachers.

ANOVA indicated that there was no significant difference in attitudes between general education and special education teachers [*F*(1, 125) = 2.273, *P* = 0.134], even though special education teachers had higher scores (M = 4.23, SD = 0.51) than general education teachers (M = 4.06, SD = 0.49). In addition, ANOVA did not find significant differences in teachers' attitudes in relation to their length of experience [*F*(4, 121) = 0.48, *P* = 0.738] and types of exposure to exceptional children [*F*(5, 118) = 1.138, *P* = 0.344].

ANOVA yielded significant differences in teachers' attitude across school levels [*F*(2, 124) = 4.30, *P* = 0.016] and workshop experience [*F*(2, 124) =7.298, *P* = 0.001]. Regarding school levels, Tukey *post hoc* comparisons of the three groups showed that elementary school teachers had more positive attitudes (M = 4.12, SD = 0.40) than middle school teachers (M = 3.92, SD = 0.55) (see Table 3). Differences among high school teachers, elementary school teachers and middle school teachers were not statistically significant. As for the workshop experience, teachers who attended autism workshops multiple times had significantly higher attitude scores (M = 4.49, SD = 0.44) than teachers who never attend workshops (M = 4.04, SD = 0.46) or those who had attended only one workshop (M = 3.96, SD = 0.55) (refer to Table 3). There was no significant difference between those who had never attended an autism workshop and those who had attended only one.

Concerning types of exposure to children with autism, multiple response analysis showed that more than 70% of the

study participants had experience teaching children with special needs. Fifty-four per cent of the respondents indicated that they learned about children with special needs in college. Fifty-three per cent had an opportunity to teach a special class, whereas 46% had volunteer work experiences with them. More importantly, the multiple response analysis revealed that 42% of the study subjects had all types of exposure. Only 2% did not have any type of exposure (see Table 4).

#### *Two-way ANOVA*

A two-way between-subjects ANOVA was conducted to evaluate the influence of educational roles (i.e., general education versus special education) and gender (male versus female) on teacher attitude. The means and SDs for these main effect groups are presented in Table 5. A significant main effect was found for educational roles, *F*(1, 123) = 12.29, *P* = 0.001. The main effect for gender was also significant, *F*(1, 123) = 4.58, *P* = 0.34. But there was interaction between the two factors, *F*(1, 123) = 8.48, *P* = 0.004 (see Figure 1).

Furthermore, two-way ANOVA was conducted to examine the influence of educational roles (general education versus special education) and school levels (elementary, middle and high schools) on teacher attitude. The means and SDs for these main effect groups are presented in Table 6. There was a significant main effect for educational roles, *F*(1, 121) = 6.49, *P* = 0.012. The main effect for school levels was partially significant, *F*(2, 121) = 2.80, *P* = 0.065. However, there was no interaction between the two factors, *F*(2, 121) = 1.49, *P* = 230.

(M = 4.06 out of 5.00). In addition, the finding revealed that teachers' attitudes were influenced by gender, age, school level and workshop experience. Female teachers had higher levels of positive attitudes towards children with autism than their male counterparts. Teachers above the age of 56 years reported significantly lower attitude score than the 20–35 years age group and the 46–55 years age group. The results also demonstrated that elementary school teachers had more positive attitudes than middle school teachers, and teachers who attended autism workshops multiple times had significantly higher attitude scores than teachers who never attended workshops or those who had attended only one workshop.

The result indicating that teachers had positive attitudes was consistent with the existing literature (e.g., Avramidis and Norwich, 2002; Royal and Roberts, 1987). The teachers' high level of positive attitudes may be attributed to the following reasons. First, the inclusion movement might have played a critical role in affecting the teachers' high levels of positive attitudes. Rosenbaum et al. (1988) found that students in schools including children with special needs had more positive attitudes than those who were in schools without inclusion. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, 1997) mandated public schools in the USA to provide free and appropriate education to all children, including children with special needs, in the least restrictive environment. This has resulted in many children with disabilities being educated in the general education classroom alongside their peers without disabilities. In this current study, the authors examined changes in teachers' attitudes from 1981 to 2009. The teachers' attitudes in 2008 were compared with those of a study done by Olley and colleagues in 1981 using the same AAST instrument for measuring teachers' attitudes. The average mean score of student teachers in 2008 was 4.06, whereas the mean score of 95 in-service education teachers in 1981 was 2.98. These researchers did not test for the significance of this difference because they did not have access to the data from Olley et al.'s study. Although several factors including inclusion may be responsible for this change in attitude, this finding should be interpreted with caution as information about the teachers who participated in Olley et al.'s study was not available to these authors.

Second, the student teachers' exposure to children with autism might have significant impact on their attitudes. As Martin (1974) indicated, a lack of exposure and understanding can result in establishing negative attitudes towards exceptional children. Royal and Roberts (1987) found that contact with individuals with disabilities can lead to positive attitude towards them. Corroborating the results of the study, Rosenbaum et al. (1988) reported that people who have friends who have disabilities tend to have more favourable attitudes towards disabilities. As indicated in Table 4, most of the teachers (98%) in the current study had some type of exposure to children with special needs, whereas only 2% did not have any exposure. A majority of the teachers (73%) had experience teaching children with special needs. More than 50% had experience teaching a special class, whereas 40% had all the types of exposure. These kinds of exposure to children with special needs might have influenced the favourable attitudes.

Furthermore, robust research about autism over the past few years could have helped to transform this otherwise esoteric disorder into a much better understood disorder. This assumption is also premised on the result of this study that young and middle-aged teachers had more positive attitudes than older teachers (refer to Table 5). Also, the teachers' positive attitudes (M = 4.06 out of 5.00) might be caused by their belief that children with autism should be integrated into regular education settings. In a recent study by Horrocks et al. (2008), which investigated principals' attitudes (N = 571) towards the inclusion of students with disabilities, they found that the principals' belief that children with autism could be included in a regular education classroom was the most significant factor in explaining both a positive attitude towards inclusion of children with disabilities and higher recommendations of placements for children with autism.

Furthermore, elementary school teachers were found to have more positive attitudes than middle or high school teachers. This result may be explained by the fact that elementary school teachers tend to spend relatively more time with children with autism (6 years) compared with middle and high school teachers (3 years), and thus have more opportunities to interact with them. As Royal and Roberts (1987) noted, more contact with autistic children might result in the higher levels of elementary schools teachers' attitudes. Al-Shammari (2006) examined special education teachers' attitudes towards children with autism in Kuwait and found that the special education teachers who participated in the telephone interview suggested that it is critical for teachers to have more time and put more effort in working with children with disabilities in order to develop positive esteem for children with autism.

Contrary to our assumption, we found that there was no significant difference in teachers' attitudes between general education and special education teachers. This result may be explained by the following reasons. First, because of the growing interest in autism among the general public (a result of promotional activities by governmental and nonprofit organisations) and the inclusion of children with autism in general education settings as mandated by the IDEA, general education teachers may also have as much exposure as special education teachers to children with autism. Second, this result may be because of the small number of special education teachers in the sample.

In this current study, we found significant difference in attitudes between teachers who had attended multiple workshop and those who had not. However, we do not know what the causal relationship between these factors is. It is possible that workshop attendance may have contributed to positive attitudes, but it is also possible that teachers with positive attitudes are more inclined to attend workshops.

Another interesting finding was that female teachers were found to hold more favourable attitudes towards autism than male teachers. This result is consistent with a recent study by Chambres et al. (2008), which found that female teachers had more favourable attitudes towards a child with autism than their male counterparts, when no information about the boy's disability was provided. There have been inconsistent results, though, regarding gender differences in attitudes towards people with disabilities, with a large number of studies reporting higher levels of attitudes for females compared with males (e.g. Archie and Sherrill, 1989; Diamond and Hesteness, 1996; Rapier, Adelson and Carey et al. 1972; Rosenbaum et al., 1988). The higher level of females' attitudes can be attributed to differences in people's empathic tendency. Most studies on empathy indicate that females score higher on empathy than males (Hoffman, 1977; Lennon and Eisenberg, 1987). In addition, Baron-Cohen (2003) noted that women are natural empathisers, whereas men are better at systemising. Lennon and Eisenberg (1987) also suggested that the differences may be explained by the difference in how boys and girls are socialized; girls tend to be socialized to be more adjusted to others' emotions than boys.

This research is not without limitations. First, because the sample was collected from school districts located in a Midwestern state, the findings of this study may not be generalised to all teachers across the country. In addition, the sample consisted of mainly females (88%), making it difficult to generalise the results across gender. Second, the AAST, which was used to measure teachers' attitudes, was developed in 1981, and therefore, it may not fully reflect attitude changes that have occurred since the instrument was developed. There is need to develop a more updated instrument that reflects current experiences of teachers. Third, because the surveys were distributed via school principals, the researchers could not control the demographics of the sample, that is, the number of males and females who participated. Also, the researchers did not have information about the teachers who did not respond to the survey. Such information could enhance interpretation of these findings.

This current study indicated that teachers' positive attitudes were influenced by their gender, age, school levels and workshop experiences. In addition to these variables, there may be other factors that contribute to teachers' favourable attitudes, including child-related variables: severity of the disability condition and educational environment-related variables (Avramidis and Norwich, 2002), teachers' personal involvement with people with autism (Rosenbaum et al., 1988) or their empathic tendency (Eisenberg and Strayer, 1986). Future research should therefore examine variables that affect teacher attitudes towards children with autism. Second, future research should explore the attitudes of pre-service teachers as they will play a critical role in establishing and implementing future policies and programmes related to the inclusion of children with autism. As Freeley (2007) suggested, college students may become future government, business and education leaders, and they are open to issues that are related to important national health and human services-related causes. Third, in order to maximise the effect of the inclusion of children with special needs, it is critical for school administrators to collaborate with not only schoolteachers, but also with parents and other professionals such as health professionals. Thus, future research should consider comparing attitude and understanding towards autistic children among teachers, parents and other professionals. Finally, because one of the biggest challenges for people with disabilities is the perception of negative attitudes towards them (Barrett and Pullo, 1993), there is a need for future research to examine how to reduce negative attitudes towards children with autism.

In conclusion, it appears there has been a positive shift in teachers' attitudes towards children with autism over the past three decades. Several factors may be responsible for this possible shift. Whatever the cause, the shift in attitudes is a welcome development for families of children with autism because teachers' attitudes may influence educational practice and outcomes for the children. Based on findings of this study, it may be necessary to promote professional development activities for schoolteachers and other professionals who work with children with autism in order to enhance their attitudes towards the children.
