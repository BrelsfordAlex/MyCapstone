# Notes about the article


This article talks about the types of training teachers need when they work with
students with ASD. The article touches on the idea that a teacher's training can really
impact a student learning in most situations. This article will help me not only figure out
what trainings work best to use and how can I improve my own teaching style to work
with students with ASD.
