## **Introduction**
**Thesis:** Effective teaching methods tailored for autistic students, such as the use of visual supports and structured routines, can significantly enhance engagement and understanding, thereby creating a more inclusive educational environment that benefits all learners.

**Why I made the Project:** I made this project because I want to help students that could be struggling and having a select number of teaching methods I can go back to look at with research backing them and how they benefit students with autism.  I want to have as many teaching methods and have an understanding of them under my boot as many as possible
