# **How Do I want it to look**
# **Justification Paper:**
## **Introduction**
**Thesis:** Effective teaching methods tailored for autistic students, such as the use of visual supports and structured routines, can significantly enhance engagement and understanding, thereby creating a more inclusive educational environment that benefits all learners.
**Teaching Methods Focused on:**
- [[Sources with Notes/Articles/A Three-Factor Model of Educational Practice Considerations for Teaching Neurodiverse Learners\|Three Factor Model]]
- [[Sources with Notes/Articles/Training Teachers to Implement Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching during  Small group Instruction_ A Pilot Study\|Classroom Pivotal Response Teaching (CPRT)]]

- [[Sources with Notes/Articles/A Model of Practice for Building Teacher Capacity in Educating Young School age Children on the Autism Spectrum User Perspectives\|Early Years Model of Practice (EY-MoP)]]
**Why I made the Project:** I made this project because I want to help students that could be struggling and having a select number of teaching methods I can go back to look at with research backing them and how they benefit students with autism.  I want to have as many teaching methods and have an understanding of them under my boot as many as possible
