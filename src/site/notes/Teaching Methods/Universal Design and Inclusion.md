> [!abstract] About Universal Design and Inclusive Education
> ## What is Universal Design?
>  **==Universal Design==** is the process of creating a classroom environment that are accessible to people with a wide range of abilities, disabilities, and other characteristics. 
>  
>  the basics of Universal design in education is the idea that a teacher can create an environment that is accessible to all students in some way. Some examples of this is *adding fidgets*, *allowing students to move around in the classroom*, giving multiple ways to engage in learning ==**(things such as *giving the notes to students*, *assignments and projects with multiple ways to do do the assignments and projects*, *allowing for students to listen to music or have noise canceling headphones when needed*, *having low energy areas allowing for students to recharge*, etc)**==
>  
>  ### The Seven Principles of Universal Design
>  * **PRINCIPLE ONE: Equitable Use**
> 	 * The design is useful to people with diverse abilities.
>  * **PRINCIPLE TWO: Flexibility in Use**
> 	 * The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.
>  *  **PRINCIPLE THREE: Simple and Intuitive Use**
> 	 * Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. 
>  *  **PRINCIPLE FOUR: Perceptible Information**
> 	 * The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.
>  *  **PRINCIPLE FIVE: Tolerance for Error**
> 	 * The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
>  *  **PRINCIPLE SIX: Low Physical Effort**
> 	 * The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.
>  *  **PRINCIPLE SEVEN: Size and Space for Approach and Use**
> 	 * Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.

> ## What is Inclusive Education
> ==**Inclusive Education**== is an education system that includes all students, and strives to support them in their learning process no matter who they are or their abilities. This could mean making sure that teaching and the curriculum, school buildings, classrooms, play areas, transport and toilets are appropriate for all children at all levels.
>  It means all children learn together in the same schools and there are ways to support all students to put them all on the same playing field.
