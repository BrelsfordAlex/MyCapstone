> [!abstract] About Universal Design and Inclusive Education
> > [!todo] ## What is Universal Design?
>  **==Universal Design==** is the process of creating a classroom environment that are accessible to people with a wide range of abilities, disabilities, and other characteristics. 
> >  the basics of Universal design in education is the idea that a teacher can create an environment that is accessible to all students in some way. Some examples of this is *adding fidgets*, *allowing students to move around in the classroom*, giving multiple ways to engage in learning ==**(things such as *giving the notes to students*, *assignments and projects with multiple ways to do do the assignments and projects*, *allowing for students to listen to music or have noise canceling headphones when needed*, *having low energy areas allowing for students to recharge*, etc)**==
> > >[!note]-  The Principles of Universal Design
> > > * **PRINCIPLE ONE: How is information represented?**
> > > 	*  there are many disabilities out there, how are you representing your information to best help not only your autistic students but all of your students in general
> > > * **PRINCIPLE TWO: How are students engaging in the classroom?**
> > > 	* Students show they are engaged in the lesson in many ways. Maybe a student is talkative and you know they are paying attention by how many questions they ask. Or maybe a student is quieter and draws. One way you could engage with this student and see their understanding is taking their strength of drawing and use that to see how much they understand. 
> > > 	* Allowing for multiple different ways to show understanding in the classroom allows for even the quietest autistic students to thrive
> > > * **PRINCIPLE THREE: How do students learn the material?**
> > > 	* Some students learn better with technology and video games while maybe another student learns better with a group activity with the teacher who helps work through the problem together. Or maybe you have a student that works better and understands the material better if they are alone. 
> > > 	* There are many different ways a student can learn the material, allowing them access to these different methods is crucial for autistic students. You want to play to their strengths and work on building their weaknesses together. 
> > > 		* Maybe a student works really well alone but struggles with group work, you could set up stations where a student can work alone but when a timer goes off students change stations and they work with a group of students without the teacher and again with the teacher. 
> > > 			* These stations could allow for every student to thrive and get help with their work not only with their peers but with the teacher and themselves. This works really well with autistic students. It gives those students a proper routine to follow and that allows the students to feel comfy in the enviornment and know what is coming nextl.

> > [!todo] ## What is Inclusive Education
> > ==**Inclusive Education**== is an education system that includes all students, and strives to support them in their learning process no matter who they are or their abilities. This could mean making sure that teaching and the curriculum, school buildings, classrooms, play areas, transport and toilets are appropriate for all children at all levels.
> >   It means all children learn together in the same schools and there are ways to support all students to put them all on the same playing field
> > >[!note]-  The basics of Inclusive Education
> > >* **Having a high expectation for what students can do**
> > >	* Teachers should have an expectation for all students on how they should act rather than how they shouldn't act 
> > >		* for example setting the expectation that students will keep the classroom clean and students will pay attention and try their best
> > >* **Individualized Support**
> > >	* Each student has the needed supports to give everyone an equitable playing field for learning and to show each students thinking and learning process
> > >* **Instructional Based Learning**
> > >	* Instructional based learning is creating alternate ways of learning the curriculum which can allow all students to do assignments in ways they will succeed the most with
> > >		* **Examples:** an assignment that allows for a creative way to do it, a writing based, and maybe a verbal based way of showing understanding. 
> > >			* Having these ways of doing the assignment allow for students to excel in the way that they do best
