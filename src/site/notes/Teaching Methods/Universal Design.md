> [!abstract] About Universal Design
> > [!todo] ## What is Universal Design?
>  **==Universal Design==** is the process of creating a classroom environment that are accessible to people with a wide range of abilities, disabilities, and other characteristics. 
> >  the basics of Universal design in education is the idea that a teacher can create an environment that is accessible to all students in some way. Some examples of this is *adding fidgets*, *allowing students to move around in the classroom*, giving multiple ways to engage in learning ==**(things such as *giving the notes to students*, *assignments and projects with multiple ways to do do the assignments and projects*, *allowing for students to listen to music or have noise canceling headphones when needed*, *having low energy areas allowing for students to recharge*, etc)**==
> > >[!note]-  The Principles of Universal Design
> > > * **PRINCIPLE ONE: How is information represented?**
> > > 	*  there are many disabilities out there, how are you representing your information to best help not only your autistic students but all of your students in general
> > > * **PRINCIPLE TWO: How are students engaging in the classroom?**
> > > 	* Students show they are engaged in the lesson in many ways. Maybe a student is talkative and you know they are paying attention by how many questions they ask. Or maybe a student is quieter and draws. One way you could engage with this student and see their understanding is taking their strength of drawing and use that to see how much they understand. 
> > > 	* Allowing for multiple different ways to show understanding in the classroom allows for even the quietest autistic students to thrive
> > > * **PRINCIPLE THREE: How do students learn the material?**
> > > 	* Some students learn better with technology and video games while maybe another student learns better with a group activity with the teacher who helps work through the problem together. Or maybe you have a student that works better and understands the material better if they are alone. 
> > > 	* There are many different ways a student can learn the material, allowing them access to these different methods is crucial for autistic students. You want to play to their strengths and work on building their weaknesses together. 
> > > 		* Maybe a student works really well alone but struggles with group work, you could set up stations where a student can work alone but when a timer goes off students change stations and they work with a group of students without the teacher and again with the teacher. 
> > > 			* These stations could allow for every student to thrive and get help with their work not only with their peers but with the teacher and themselves. This works really well with autistic students. It gives those students a proper routine to follow and that allows the students to feel comfy in the enviornment and know what is coming next.
